### introduction

If you found this through searching, you may have encountered the same problem as me. When an Apple Developer account has multiple App-related Certificates, Certificates, and Profiles, it becomes very troublesome to view the detailed information of each profile. Although Apple provides a filtering function, it still cannot solve the problem I mentioned. I can&#39;t understand why Apple&#39;s PM is designed in the list of &#39;&#39;&#39;resources/identifiers/list&#39;&#39;&#39;. Clicking a configuration file will update the current browser tab instead of opening a new tab. I think this is a very stupid design. Well, this Chrome Extension is designed to solve this problem.

**This Chrome Extension currently meets my needs. If you have additional needs, you can develop on this basis.**
